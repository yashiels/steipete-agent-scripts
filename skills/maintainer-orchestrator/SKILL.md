# Maintainer Orchestrator

Coordinate repository work through completion. This is a control-plane skill: inspect, delegate, monitor, ask decisions, and report. Put substantial repository investigation, implementation, review, live proof, landing, and release execution in repository worker threads.

## Repository Scope

- Own repositories where Peter is the majority commit author, regardless of GitHub owner.
- Exclude all repositories under the `openclaw` and `clawhub` organizations unless the owner explicitly overrides this exclusion for a named item.
- Exclude archived repositories from routine discovery, queue scans, dependency audits, monitoring, release gating, and reporting. Re-enter only when the owner explicitly names the repository and requests new work.
- When the owner says a repository is retired, archived, or must not be mentioned again, record it as suppressed. Make one best-effort archive mutation when requested, then keep it silent even when permissions prevent the remote archive.
- Determine uncertain ownership from repository contribution history, not repository name alone.
- Keep a current repository ledger so completed lanes are replaced by real queue or release work.

## Operating Model

1. Use `github-project-triage` to map each repository's open issues, open PRs, CI, latest release, package metadata, and unreleased changelog.
2. Classify every queue item:
   - `Autonomous`: clear fit, reproducible, bounded implementation, and usable verification path.
   - `Needs owner`: product choice, security/privacy decision, unavailable credentials/access, unavailable live proof, or destructive/irreversible choice.
   - `Ignored by owner`: an explicitly named item the owner says must not affect current work.
3. When delegation is explicitly authorized, this root orchestrator session delegates independent repositories to separate Codex threads. Whenever assigning or materially changing work, rename the worker thread to `<Project>: <short current task>`. Keep work for one repository in its existing thread. Do not set or request a custom model; omit model selection and inherit the platform default.
4. Keep this coordinator thread lightweight. Do not perform extensive repository work here. Delegate it to a repository thread, then monitor by reading current state.
5. Monitor workers every five minutes when the owner requests continuous orchestration. Let active workers execute without steering; intervene only for a confirmed blocker, exhausted work, or gross course deviation.
6. Continue until each autonomous item is merged/closed with proof, each decision item has a mergeable PR ready for owner land/delete choice, an authorized release clears its release-specific blockers, or an otherwise idle repository has current dependencies.

Do not treat ordinary draft, stale, difficult, or platform-specific items as ignored. Only an explicit owner instruction can create an ignored-item exception. Keep ignored items open and visible; do not close, edit, or merge them unless separately requested.

## Control-Plane Ownership

- Only this root orchestrator session may create, reuse, fork, assign, rename, archive, or steer worker threads.
- Repository workers perform only their assigned repository work and report results to this orchestrator. They must not create subworkers, delegate work, or manage other chats.
- Put the no-subdelegation rule in every worker prompt.
- Do not delegate portfolio triage, thread creation, or worker management to another worker.
- Legacy nested coordinators: stop further delegation immediately, preserve unique context while their existing workers finish, then retire them after reading current state.

## Decision-Ready Queue Rule

Do not ask the owner to decide from an unprepared issue or rough contributor branch.

- Existing PR: inspect, reproduce, rewrite/fix as needed, add tests/docs/changelog, run live proof and autoreview, push the final candidate, and get required CI green. Ask only when the PR is mergeable or the remaining blocker cannot be solved autonomously.
- Issue without PR: investigate root cause and product constraints, implement the best bounded candidate on a branch, create a PR, and drive it to the same mergeable proof state.
- Product decision: choose a reversible default when technically safe and expose the decision clearly in the PR. Prepare alternatives in the PR description when useful.
- Access or live-proof blocker: finish code, tests, docs, review, and CI first. Ask only for the exact remaining credential, account action, hardware interaction, waiver, or land/delete decision.
- Rejection candidate: produce concrete research and proof. When a code candidate would clarify the tradeoff, prepare the PR anyway; otherwise update the issue with the evidence needed for an owner close/keep decision.

The normal owner interaction should be one of: land the prepared PR, delete/close it, provide one exact access step, or choose between clearly documented alternatives.

## Owner Decision Briefs

Never ask for `land/delete`, approval, access, waiver, or a product choice with only a URL or status label.

Immediately before asking, refresh the item and worker state. Do not repeat a question the owner already answered, and do not present an item as decision-ready when it has become conflicted, stale, red, or otherwise moved behind an autonomous repair gate.

Every owner decision request must include:

- full canonical clickable URL and title;
- plain-language explanation of what changes and who benefits;
- why the decision is needed now;
- completed proof: reproduction, live test, tests, autoreview, CI, and mergeability as applicable;
- material tradeoffs, residual risks, scope concerns, or missing evidence;
- the orchestrator's recommendation and concise rationale;
- the exact choices available and what each choice does.

When several decisions are grouped, give each item its own brief. Keep the recommendation opinionated; do not offload technical analysis to the owner. If autonomous work remains, do that work first and report the item as active rather than asking for a premature decision.

## Monitoring Protocol

Assume another person or agent may have steered every worker since the last poll.

Before sending any worker message:

1. Read the worker's latest current state, including its newest user/delegation messages and active turn.
2. Treat the newest thread-local instruction as authoritative over older orchestration plans.
3. Determine whether the worker is actively progressing, blocked, completed, or idle.
4. Send nothing when an active worker has a coherent plan and is making progress.

Intervene only when evidence shows one of:

- the worker explicitly requests coordination or reports a blocker;
- the worker has completed or run out of autonomous work and needs a next queue item;
- repeated failures show no progress and a concrete correction is available;
- wrong repository/item, unauthorized mutation, destructive action, security risk, release-gate violation, or direct conflict with the owner's latest instruction;
- implementation has grossly diverged from the accepted task, not merely chosen a different reasonable design.

Do not restate the task, add speculative requirements, or raise the proof bar mid-flight. Apply the live-proof gate from initial delegation; never downgrade missing live proof to a release-only blocker. Prefer one concise question over prescriptive steering when current intent is ambiguous.

Never interrupt, archive, rename, duplicate, or replace a worker without first reading its current state. For a suspected duplicate, read both threads; if either has unique progress, edits, or an active turn, leave it alone and ask the owner before changing thread state.

## Thread Naming

- Rename a worker whenever giving it a new task or materially changing its assignment.
- Format every worker title as `<Project>: <short current task>`.
- Read the latest state and newest thread-local instructions before renaming.
- Keep the title specific to current work; replace stale original-task titles.
- Polling alone does not justify a rename.

## Persistent Log

- This root orchestrator owns `~/oss-orchestrator.md`; workers do not edit it.
- Append dated, high-level entries for meaningful actions and decisions: policy/skill/automation changes, worker creation or reassignment, queue decisions, lands, closes, releases, and exact blockers.
- Include full canonical issue/PR URLs when relevant.
- Never record secrets or routine polling.

## Idle Thread Closeout

An idle or completed repository thread must not remain a polling-only lane. After reading its latest state, inspect that repository's current queue, CI, latest release, package metadata, and unreleased changelog. Then do exactly one:

1. Assign the next autonomous issue or PR to the same repository thread.
2. Prepare each remaining non-autonomous item to the decision-ready boundary, then ask the owner a concise concrete question: land/delete, choose a documented alternative, provide exact access, or grant a live-proof waiver.
3. When a release is authorized, execute it after all release-specific blockers and release gates pass. Open backlog alone does not delay a release.
4. If no queue or authorized release work remains, audit and update dependencies to current stable releases. Delegate this as normal repository work: inspect upstream changes and package health, honor repository-specific stabilization policies, avoid prerelease-only upgrades unless already adopted, preserve the repository's package manager, add compatibility fixes/tests when needed, run exact built/live proof, autoreview, the Public Model Identifier Gate, and required CI, then prepare or land the update within granted permissions.

Do not keep completed threads merely to satisfy a lane count. A monitored repository should have active autonomous work, a pending owner question, an active release, or a documented reason no release is warranted.

Dependency freshness is a backstop, not higher priority than real queue or release work.

## Authorization

Treat triage, monitoring, implementation, public mutation, and release as separate permissions.

- Queue analysis or monitoring does not authorize edits.
- Delegation or parallel-worker creation requires explicit owner authorization.
- Implementation permission authorizes local changes and verification only unless the owner also authorizes push/PR updates.
- Push permission does not imply merge or close permission.
- CI rerun and CI-fix permission must be explicit; a push alone does not authorize additional repair commits or workflow mutations.
- Merge/close permission must be explicit for the affected work.
- Release, version bump, tag, registry publish, and GitHub Release require a current explicit release request.
- Release permission must explicitly include required branch/tag pushes or be paired with push permission.

Record the granted permissions in each worker prompt. Without the required permission, stop at the last authorized boundary and report the exact next action.

## Credential Access

Assume most maintainer credentials are stored in 1Password. Before reporting a credential blocker:

1. Check only the exact expected environment variable; use it only when already exported.
2. Read the service-specific auth skill, then use `$one-password` and targeted `op` access.
3. Prefer the scoped service-account path; use the required persistent tmux session and exact known item/vault/field.
4. Never broadly enumerate secrets or print values. Use `op run` or `op inject` when supported.
5. Ask the owner only after the targeted 1Password path is absent, inaccessible, or requires interactive unlock/approval.

Keep credential discovery and use inside the worker that needs the secret. Report only presence, access path, and the exact missing approval or item; never send credentials between threads.

## Worker Contract

Every delegated implementation thread, within its explicit authorization, must:

- read the full issue/PR discussion, repo instructions, docs, and relevant code;
- when an issue has no PR, create one after implementing the best bounded candidate;
- reproduce or establish root cause before accepting an existing patch;
- rewrite when a cleaner bounded design is available;
- add regression coverage when appropriate;
- run focused and full tests, then live/end-to-end proof against the real affected boundary before landing;
- run `autoreview` until no accepted/actionable findings remain;
- when push is authorized, push the authorized changes;
- when CI rerun/fix is authorized, rerun required checks and repair failures until green;
- when CI rerun/fix is not authorized and checks fail, stop with the exact failure and requested permission;
- when merge/close is authorized, merge or close the queue item with an exact proof comment;
- after authorized landing, return to updated, clean `main`.

Prefer repairing the contributor PR. Preserve contributor credit and follow the workspace PR rules.
When landing is not yet authorized, stop only after the branch is pushed, the PR is mergeable, required CI is green, live proof is recorded, and the exact owner decision is stated.

## Live Proof Gate

Live proof is a pre-land requirement, not optional polish.

- Test the exact final candidate commit through the changed user path using the real built/installed artifact and real service, account, device, OS, or external provider as applicable.
- For external integrations, authenticated live calls are required. Docs, mocks, fixtures, protocol captures, route-existence checks, and CI supplement live proof; they do not replace it.
- Redact secrets and private user data while retaining concrete evidence such as command, behavior, response class, artifact hash, or observed state transition.
- If credentials, account state, hardware, platform access, or a safe live target are unavailable, finish all autonomous code, tests, review, and CI work, then stop before merge/close. Ask for the exact access, an explicit item-specific waiver, or a reject/close decision.
- Never infer a live-proof waiver from merge permission, release permission, prior contributor evidence, or confidence in mocks.
- Re-run live proof after any fix that changes the relevant runtime path.
- Pure docs, metadata, CI, or test-only changes with no runtime boundary may use the closest built-artifact or workflow proof; state why no external live boundary applies.

Record live evidence or the owner's explicit waiver in the landing proof comment.

## Public Model Identifier Gate

Before any push, public PR update, merge, or release involving model-bearing code or artifacts:

- Audit the exact candidate diff, tests, fixtures, snapshots, generated metadata, workflows, CI/test logs, packaged artifacts, and public PR/issue proof for model identifiers.
- Public artifacts may retain only identifiers currently documented or offered in an official public provider source. Record the source URL in the worker's audit report.
- Never expose internal, employee-only, preview-only, alias-only, inferred, synthetic provider-shaped, or otherwise undisclosed identifiers. Genericize questionable test and fixture values because assertion failures can print them in CI logs.
- Do not repeat a questionable identifier in worker messages, audit reports, public comments, or the orchestrator log. Describe it generically.
- Binary/archive scans must classify candidate strings as verified public identifiers, unrelated false positives, or blocking unknowns without echoing blocking unknowns.
- Return an explicit `PASS` or `BLOCKED` report covering every audited surface. Any new candidate diff, generated artifact, log/proof text, or model-bearing change invalidates the pass and requires re-audit.

No push, public mutation, merge, or release may proceed while this gate is blocked.

## Release Gate

Open issues and PRs are backlog inventory, not release blockers by default. Compute only the candidate-specific blocker set immediately before release:

```text
release blockers = items explicitly scoped to the target release
                 + active authorized work promised for the target release
                 + demonstrated regressions affecting the release candidate
```

Do not ask the owner to exempt unrelated open issues or PRs. An item blocks only when repository metadata, an owner instruction, the release plan, or concrete validation ties it to the target release. Security exposure, data loss, broken install/upgrade, and candidate regressions block when they affect the candidate even without a milestone or label.

Release only when all are true:

- the owner has explicitly requested this release or authorized release execution for the repository;
- the release-specific blocker count is zero;
- required CI is green for the exact commit and branch/tag candidate being released;
- all user-facing runtime changes in the release have required live proof, unless the owner explicitly waives that proof for the release;
- release checkout is clean, on the expected branch, and fast-forward current;
- unreleased changes justify a release and the target version follows SemVer/project convention.

Recheck release-specific blockers, the candidate diff, and CI immediately before tagging or publishing. Abort if any gate changes.

In release reporting, list actual release blockers reviewed and their resolution. Do not enumerate or request waivers for unrelated backlog.

## Release Execution

Use the repository's release docs and matching skill:

- npm packages: use `npm`;
- macOS apps: use `release-mac-app`;
- other projects: use established repo scripts/workflows.

Before release:

- reconcile changelog history with existing tags/releases;
- default to patch for compatible fixes, maintenance, refactors, docs, CI, and small behavior improvements;
- select minor only for substantial additive functionality, a meaningful new feature set, or a new backward-compatible public API;
- never use minor merely because several fixes accumulated; major requires explicit approval;
- run full release checks and review release-only edits.

After publishing, verify the actual release:

- Git tag and GitHub Release exist;
- release notes contain the complete changelog section;
- expected artifacts/install path work;
- npm packages show version, dist-tag, tarball, integrity, and publish time;
- release body links registry/artifact/integrity and CI proof when applicable.

Then open the next patch `Unreleased` section. Commit and push the closeout only when those mutations are authorized; otherwise leave the verified local closeout ready and report the exact permission needed. After an authorized push, pull `--ff-only` and finish on clean `main`.

## Reporting

Keep one compact cross-repo ledger:

- `Active`: repo, item URL, worker, current phase.
- `Intervened`: exact risk and instruction sent.
- `Needs owner`: exact decision/access required; no vague "needs review".
- `Ignored`: exact item and owner-granted exception.
- `Released`: version, tag/registry verification, closeout commit.
- `Ready next`: release-specific blockers clear, CI green, recommended patch/minor version and rationale.

Omit archived and owner-suppressed repositories entirely. Do not list them as ignored, blocked, stale, or available work.

Whenever mentioning an issue or PR in any owner report, decision question, worker message, or status update, print its full canonical clickable URL. Never use only a repository-local number such as `#123`; include `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/123` or `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/123`.

For `Needs owner`, use the Owner Decision Brief format. Never emit a bare URL plus `land/delete`.

Report meaningful changes, not routine polling. Maintain a heartbeat automation when the user asks to keep monitoring.
