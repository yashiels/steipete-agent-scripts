# Fleet Maintenance

Maintain Peter's Macs while protecting ambiguous local work. Package updates are explicitly allowed during active sessions and may disrupt the software being upgraded. Use `$remote-mac` for inventory/SSH and `$xcode-sync` for all Xcode work.

## Safety contract

- Read `~/Projects/manager/computers.yaml`; use live Tailscale state and deduplicate hosts by hardware UUID. Exclude handed-off and unknown machines.
- Audit hosts in parallel; mutate one host at a time. Recheck agent activity immediately before every repo or Xcode mutation.
- Skip repositories with a user process cwd inside them or a Git lock. Recent files are audit signal, not a blocker. Permit dirty worktrees only through the conflict-free fast-forward procedure below.
- Homebrew and global npm updates are allowed while agents/services are running. This can mix old in-memory code with replaced files, break later imports or child processes, and let Homebrew terminate/reopen cask GUI apps. Accept that package-update risk; never manually terminate or restart services. Verify health and report interruptions or pending restarts.
- Never reset, clean, stash, rebase, switch branches, delete local work, push, install macOS updates, or reboot during routine maintenance.
- Snapshot role-critical services before package updates. Do not restart OpenClaw gateways or other services unless explicitly authorized; verify them afterward using their owning skill.
- Keep a per-host action log. An unreachable host is pending, never current.

## Run order

1. Inventory, package ownership, and preflight.
2. Sync eligible repos using the existing Git/toolchain.
3. Update Homebrew and global npm packages on every eligible, reachable host regardless of active agents/services.
4. Verify each host's macOS stable/beta track.
5. Sync Xcode through `$xcode-sync`.
6. Empty Trash only when explicitly requested for this run; perform approved package cleanup.
7. Re-audit disk, tools, package ownership, repos, memory, and role-critical services.

## Preflight

Record hostname, hardware UUID, macOS, architecture, uptime, Tailscale state, selected Xcode, free bytes/percent, Trash size, Homebrew prefix/version, Node/npm versions, running Brew services, active coding-agent processes, and resident-memory outliers:

```bash
skills/fleet-maintenance/scripts/host-health-audit.sh 30
ssh -o RequestTTY=no -o RemoteCommand=none HOST 'bash -s -- 30' \
  < skills/fleet-maintenance/scripts/host-health-audit.sh
```

Report every process above 30 GiB resident memory. Do not alert on virtual size alone, sum related processes, or terminate a process automatically. Record PID, resident GiB, user, executable, role, and whether memory remains above the threshold on a second sample.

Classify startup-disk space using both absolute and relative capacity:

- healthy: at least 100 GiB and 15% free
- warning: 50–100 GiB or 10–15% free
- critical: below 50 GiB or 10% free

Do not start Xcode expansion on warning/critical space. Never delete outside Trash, superseded package-manager artifacts, or Xcode paths governed by `$xcode-sync` without explicit approval.

## Repository sync

Run the read-only candidate audit on each host:

```bash
skills/fleet-maintenance/scripts/repo-sync-audit.sh ~/Projects 3
ssh -o RequestTTY=no -o RemoteCommand=none HOST 'bash -s -- "$HOME/Projects" 3' \
  < skills/fleet-maintenance/scripts/repo-sync-audit.sh
```

Only process rows marked `candidate`. Recheck branch, upstream, Git locks, and active process cwd immediately before mutation, then:

```bash
git -C "$repo" fetch --prune
git -C "$repo" rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{upstream}
```

Run fetches noninteractively and bound each one (for example five minutes). On timeout, authentication failure, or network failure, terminate that fetch, mark the repo pending, and continue. Never let one stale/private mirror stall the host, rewrite its remote, or prompt for credentials during fleet maintenance.

Interpret counts as `ahead behind`:

- `0 0`: current; no action.
- `0 N`: inspect `git log --oneline HEAD..@{upstream}` and `git diff --stat HEAD..@{upstream}`. Record `HEAD` and worktree status. Run `git merge --ff-only @{upstream}` without stash or autostash. A clean worktree should advance. A dirty worktree may advance only when Git can preserve every local change without overlap; Git refusal means `skip-local-overlap`, not an error to repair. After success, require no unmerged entries, the expected upstream commit at `HEAD`, and all prior local modifications still present. After refusal, require unchanged `HEAD`, no unmerged entries, and unchanged worktree status.
- `N 0` or `N M`: inspect local commit subjects/authors and `git diff --stat @{upstream}...HEAD`; explain likely intent and escalate. Never push or rewrite.
- detached/no upstream/fetch failure: understand remotes, branches, recent commits, and worktree state; escalate with the smallest useful decision.

Do not infer that a stale local checkout should match a sibling checkout. Each visible checkout is user-managed.

Never use `pull` or `merge` as a conflict resolver. Never pass `--autostash`, create a stash, discard changes, or stage files. A non-fast-forward, checkout-overwrite warning, merge conflict, or changed safety snapshot stops that repository only; continue the fleet pass.

## Homebrew

Skip only if Homebrew is absent. Running agents/services do not block package mutation:

```bash
brew update
brew outdated --json=v2
brew upgrade
brew services list
brew doctor
```

Treat `brew doctor` as advisory; do not blindly apply its suggestions. Compare services before/after. Use `brew cleanup --prune=30` after successful verification; use more aggressive cleanup only for disk pressure and explicit approval.

If an upgrade replaces Node, Git, Codex, or another executable used by an active agent/service, accept that later imports or child processes may observe new files and report the risk. Allow Homebrew's controlled quit/reopen for cask GUI apps, including possible session termination; do not manually restart services, change taps, or uninstall packages automatically.

## Package ownership

Run `scripts/host-health-audit.sh` before and after package mutations. Investigate its ownership candidates plus duplicate launchd labels/listeners, executable version skew, and collisions across Homebrew formulae/casks, global npm, standalone apps, and app-bundled CLIs.

For each candidate, resolve executable realpaths, package receipts, service definitions, listeners, running processes, dependents, versions, and intended host role. Prefer one canonical owner. Disable or uninstall a redundant owner only when its replacement is healthy, no installed package depends on it, and the current request authorizes the fix. Never infer a conflict from a shared name alone; formula/app pairs can be intentional.

## Global npm packages

“Update npm” means registry-backed, top-level global packages—not project dependencies. Never change a repository's `package.json` or lockfile here.

1. Record `node --version`, `npm --version`, `npm prefix -g`, and `npm ls -g --depth=0 --json`.
2. Run `npm outdated -g --depth=0 --json`; its nonzero exit can mean updates exist.
3. Update each registry package to `name@latest`. Skip linked, file, Git, bundled, and ambiguous packages; report them.
4. Let the owner update npm itself: Homebrew updates a Homebrew Node/npm; only use `npm install -g npm@latest` for a self-managed npm installation. Verify the resulting `npm --version`.
5. Re-run inventory and smoke-test the updated global CLIs. Use `$npm` and `$one-password` only if a private package actually requires registry authentication; never expose npm credentials.

Major global-package updates are intended even when the package currently backs an active coding agent or service. Accept the risk of mixed old/new files; do not restart the process. Smoke-test the newly installed CLI separately and report failures or pending restarts.

## macOS track

Record `sw_vers` product/build and current beta-seed enrollment. Resolve the latest stable and current beta build from authoritative current Apple sources; do not hardcode versions or infer track from version number alone. Use `softwareupdate --list` to confirm what the host is actually offered on its configured track.

Classify each Mac as current, update available, track ambiguous, unsupported, or unreachable. Preserve its configured stable/beta track. Routine maintenance does not switch tracks, install macOS updates, or reboot: prepare the exact update and request a maintenance window after confirming no active agents/services and adequate backup/disk state.

## Xcode

Invoke `$xcode-sync`; do not duplicate its install logic. Resolve current stable/beta/RC versions from an authoritative current source, not hardcoded versions. Preserve each host's selected stable or prerelease track while maintaining the canonical stable/prerelease slots and previous-major retention policy defined there.

Verify product build, signature, first-launch state, selection, host compatibility, and free space. Report unsupported and unreachable Macs separately.

## Trash and disk

Measure Trash on every run. Keep it read-only unless the current request explicitly says to clear/empty Trash. With that consent, empty only the current user's home-volume Trash after resolving and verifying the path:

```bash
trash="$HOME/.Trash"
home_real=$(cd "$HOME" && pwd -P)
trash_real=$(cd "$trash" && pwd -P)
if [[ "$trash_real" != "$home_real/.Trash" ]]; then
  printf 'refusing unexpected Trash path: %s\n' "$trash_real" >&2
  exit 2
fi
find "$trash_real" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -exec rm -rf {} +
```

Never empty another user's Trash or Trash on external volumes. Recheck disk capacity afterward; escalate unexplained growth instead of broad cache deletion.

## Baseline health checks

Include these read-only checks in the report; mutations need separate authority:

- available macOS/security updates and whether a reboot is recommended
- Mac App Store application drift via `mas outdated`, when `mas` is installed
- last successful Time Machine backup, when configured
- SMART/storage warnings and APFS volume health signals available from `diskutil`
- uptime, clock synchronization, and laptop battery health/cycle count
- Tailscale reachability/version drift
- failed Brew services and role-specific LaunchAgents/daemons
- FileVault, firewall, Gatekeeper, and SIP status drift
- Developer ID certificate and important SSH credential expiry dates, never secret values

Useful optional maintenance: stale package caches/logs, abandoned containers/VMs, old simulators/device support, orphaned launch agents, and large Downloads. Audit first; delete only with explicit scope.

## Finish

Return a host matrix with: reachability, active/deferred reason, disk before/after, Trash reclaimed, Brew/npm changes, repos pulled/current/skipped/escalated, Xcode stable/prerelease build and selected track, backup/update/service warnings, and remaining user decisions.
