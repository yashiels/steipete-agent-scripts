# Peekaboo Release

Release `~/Projects/Peekaboo` as the npm package `@steipete/peekaboo` plus signed/notarized macOS app assets.

Use `$one-password`, `$browser-use`, `$npm`, `$codex-review`, and repo `AGENTS.md` rules. Keep all `op` secret work inside one persistent tmux session. Never print `.p8`, npm tokens, passwords, or OTPs.

## Current Secrets

Canonical automation item:

- vault: `Molty`
- title: `API Key - App Store Connect - Personal - Release`
- fields: `key_id`, `issuer_id`, `private_key_p8`
- service token: `MOLTY_OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`
- status: if the service account returns `Service Account Deleted`, use desktop `op --account my.1password.com` and restore the Molty service account before the next release.
- current key id: `AKVLXW849T`
- issuer id: `69a6de84-c8a9-47e3-e053-5b8c7c11a4d1`
- App Store Connect key name: `Peekaboo Release 3.2.1`
- access: `Admin`

Legacy mirror:

- vault: `Private`
- title: `API Key - App Store Connect - Personal`
- Keep synced to the same current key so older refs do not use stale material.

Revoked old key:

- `Peekaboo Release 3.2.0` / `7HRXH68LLU`, revoked 2026-05-18.

Sparkle key:

- `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/Users/steipete/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Backup/Sparkle/sparkle-private-key-KEEP-SECURE.txt`

Developer ID release keychain:

- vault: `Molty`
- title: `Peekaboo Release Keychain`
- fields: `keychain_path`, `keychain_password`, `certificate_source`
- current path: `/Users/steipete/Library/Keychains/peekaboo-release-321-20260518132141.keychain-db`

npm publish token:

- vault: `Private`
- title: `API Token - npm - Personal`
- field: `token`
- Use only through a temp npmrc; delete temp files immediately. If this token requires npm web auth, use the `npmjs` TOTP item and delete any short-lived bypass tokens created during retries.

## Notary Credential Check

Use the service account first. Put the token in the tmux environment without printing it:

```bash
tmux -S "$SOCKET" set-environment -t "$SESSION" OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN "$MOLTY_OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"
```

Create a temp env file with service-account refs:

```text
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8=op://Molty/API Key - App Store Connect - Personal - Release/private_key_p8
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID=op://Molty/API Key - App Store Connect - Personal - Release/key_id
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=op://Molty/API Key - App Store Connect - Personal - Release/issuer_id
SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/Users/steipete/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Backup/Sparkle/sparkle-private-key-KEEP-SECURE.txt
```

Before a release, verify shape and Apple auth without printing values:

```bash
op run --env-file "$ENVFILE" -- bash -c '
  set -euo pipefail
  KEY_FILE="/tmp/AuthKey_${APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID}.p8"
  printf "%s\n" "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8" > "$KEY_FILE"
  chmod 600 "$KEY_FILE"
  test "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID" = "AKVLXW849T"
  xcrun notarytool history \
    --key "$KEY_FILE" \
    --key-id "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID" \
    --issuer "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID" \
    --output-format json >/dev/null
  rm -f "$KEY_FILE"
'
```

Peekaboo forces `notarytool submit --no-s3-acceleration`; the default S3 accelerated upload path can return a misleading `401` even when `history` auth succeeds.

If both `history` and non-S3 `submit` fail, suspect wrong access level or stale key. Browser route:

1. Use `$browser-use` real Chrome profile.
2. Open `https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api`.
3. Generate Team Key named `Peekaboo Release <version>` with `Admin` access.
4. Download `.p8` once from the key row.
5. Store immediately into both 1Password items above; verify `notarytool history`; delete `~/Downloads/AuthKey_<key_id>.p8`.
6. Revoke the older Peekaboo release key after the new key validates.

## Release Flow

1. Start on clean `main`; pull ff-only if needed.
2. Set version in:
   - `package.json`
   - `version.json`
   - `Apps/CLI/Sources/Resources/version.json`
   - README npm badge
   - `Core/PeekabooCore/Sources/PeekabooAgentRuntime/MCP/PeekabooMCPVersion.swift`
   - Xcode marketing versions under `Apps/*`
3. Date `CHANGELOG.md` and `Apps/CLI/CHANGELOG.md` for the release.
4. Run focused proof or release script preflight. Release gates must be warning-free.
5. Use `$codex-review` before commit unless the change is trivial/docs-only.
6. Commit release prep with `committer`.
7. Push `main`.
8. Run:

```bash
op run --env-file "$ENVFILE" -- \
  bash -lc 'printf "y\n" | ./scripts/release-binaries.sh --create-github-release --publish-npm'
```

The script builds universal CLI, npm package, signed/notarized app zip, appcast, checksums, draft GitHub release, and npm publish.

Notarized releases must sign with `Developer ID Application: Peter Steinberger (Y5PE65HELJ)`, not `Apple Development`. If your shell has `SIGN_IDENTITY` exported for CLI builds, override it for the release command.

If npm upload is slow and TOTP expires, use the stored npm token through a temp npmrc and complete npm web auth immediately when prompted. Do not create granular bypass tokens unless necessary; if created, delete them from `https://www.npmjs.com/settings/steipete/tokens` before closeout.

## Verify

Required before closeout:

```bash
npm view @steipete/peekaboo@<version> version dist-tags dist.tarball dist.integrity time --json
gh release view v<version> --repo openclaw/Peekaboo --json tagName,isDraft,isPrerelease,url,assets,body
xmllint --noout appcast.xml
git status --short --branch
```

Confirm:

- npm version exists and `latest` points to it.
- GitHub release/tag/assets exist; release body is from changelog.
- app zip asset exists and appcast points at `v<version>`.
- `appcast.xml` changes are committed and pushed.
- Publish draft release if the script leaves it draft.

## Closeout

1. Add next patch `Unreleased` section to root and CLI changelogs.
2. Commit with `committer "docs(changelog): open <next-version>" CHANGELOG.md Apps/CLI/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Push.
4. Watch release/homebrew/CI workflows if triggered.
5. `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only && git status --short --branch`.
6. Clear tmux `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`, remove temp env/key files, and final with what landed.
